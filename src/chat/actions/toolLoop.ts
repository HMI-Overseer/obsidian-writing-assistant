 * Cap a round to a single mutation so the in-loop approval gate is a genuine per-tool

 * user's approve/decline *between* rounds; a round carrying several mutating calls means
 * the model committed to the whole batch before any of them was reviewed (the symptom:
 * five `create_directory` ops where only the first shows "pending approval" and the rest
 * say "waiting for the previous step").
 *
 * Keeps every read-only / think call up to and including the first mutating
 * (edit / vault-op / unknown-write) call and returns the rest as the deferred tail.
 * The loop buffers that tail and drains it one mutation per subsequent round (see the
 * drain branch in {@link runToolLoop}), so the model's whole batch is honored, each op
 * gated in turn, without relying on the model to re-emit the dropped calls (local
 * models routinely don't). A pure read-only / think round is returned unchanged, those
 * need no approval and run in parallel, so multi-search rounds keep their concurrency.
 *
 * This is the engine-independent backstop for the request-level
 * `parallel_tool_calls:false` (OpenAI) / `disable_parallel_tool_use` (Anthropic) flags,
 * which cloud providers honor but local OpenAI-compatible servers (LM Studio / llama.cpp)
 * accept and silently ignore. Pure (no state, no callbacks), so the boundary is
