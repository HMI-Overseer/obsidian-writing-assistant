/**
 * Owns the drawer's approval lane for one generation (RFC-0012).
 *
 * Deliberately the same shape as {@link AskInteractionCoordinator}: generation-scoped
 * over the composer host and the generation's abort signal, one-shot, and knowing
 * nothing about vault ops, edits, or memories. It reports a decision; the channel that
 * raised the request performs it and resolves its own parked promise. So the tool result
 * still cannot assert an outcome the timeline does not already hold.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 *   - **It never resolves a parked promise.** `LiveVaultReview.cancelPending()` already
 *     owns resolving every outstanding decision as `cancelled`, and it is already bound
 *     to this same signal. Two owners for one settlement is how double-resolve bugs
 *     start, so abort here only clears the drawer.
 *   - **It never queues.** The host is single-slot; a second request while one is active
 *     is refused *before its channel parks*, so nothing is awaiting, nothing is shown,
 *     and nothing is written. The caller turns the refusal into a retryable failure,
 *     which is what every other contention case in this codebase already does.
