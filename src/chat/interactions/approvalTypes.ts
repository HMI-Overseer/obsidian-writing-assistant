/**
 * The channel-agnostic live-approval contract (RFC-0012).
 *
 * While a generation is live, every approval decision is made in the composer
 * interaction drawer; the timeline is a record (status, evidence, undo) and carries
 * no live decision control. This file is the whole vocabulary that crossing needs:
 * a request the parked channel raises, and a decision the drawer reports back.
 *
 * Deliberately absent:
 *   - an outcome type. The interaction settles on submit, so the decision callback
 *     returns nothing and a failed apply is reported as a failure on the tool result
 *     rather than re-opening the drawer.
 *   - a withdrawal reason. The lane is single-slot and a second request is refused
 *     *before it parks*, so nothing is ever shown and then taken away.
